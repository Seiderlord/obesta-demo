# Welcome to Backend Demo

This project is a very basic example of the backend server app.
It is mostly to present the minimum of configurations to build a resource server app.
The example code is not fully configured, and the placeholders in the configuration files need to be replaced before executing the app.

To execute the project run:
```
mvn spring-boot:run
```
To package the project run:
```
mvn clean package spring-boot:repackage
```
